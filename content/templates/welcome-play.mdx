# Welcome-Play Morning Routine

## Overview

**Welcome-Play** is a carefully designed morning routine that aligns with the NCF pillars of **Well-being** and **Creativity**. This activity creates a warm, nurturing environment where children ages 3–5 can transition smoothly into the school day while expressing themselves through various forms of play.

The routine emphasizes emotional safety, peer connection, and creative exploration—foundational elements for healthy early childhood development.

---

## Activity Breakdown

   - Sing a familiar welcome song in the child's home language
   - Examples: "Hello Song" (EN), "Goeiemore Lied" (AF), "Sawubona" (ZU)
   - Include actions: waving, clapping, touching toes

2. **Feelings Check-In** (3 min)
   - Show emotions chart with faces (happy, sad, excited, tired)
   - Each child points to or names their feeling
   - Teacher validates: "Lwazi feels excited today! That's wonderful!"

3. **Today's Theme** (1 min)
   - Briefly introduce the day: "Today is about friendship!"
   - No pressure—just a gentle framework

**NCF Connection:** Builds emotional literacy (Well-being) and communication skills

---

### Phase 2: Free-Choice Play Stations (15–20 minutes)

**Objective:** Allow autonomous creative exploration

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Younger Children (3 years)

- Shorter duration (20 min total)
- More teacher support at stations
- Simpler materials (larger blocks, chunky crayons)
- Buddy system for circle time

### For Older Children (5 years)

- Extend free play to 25 minutes
- Introduce collaborative projects ("Let's build a zoo together!")
- Add writing station (name practice, drawing + dictation)
- Peer leadership roles ("Who wants to lead the song?")

### For Children with Special Needs

- **Sensory Sensitivities:** Offer noise-canceling headphones, quiet corner
- **Motor Challenges:** Adaptive tools (triangular crayons, larger blocks)
- **Language Barriers:** Visual schedules, gestures, peer buddies
- **Attention Needs:** Smaller group size, shorter intervals, more movement

## Teacher Tips

### Before the Activity

- ✅ Set up stations the night before
- ✅ Test play-dough consistency (add water if dry)
- ✅ Create visual schedule with pictures

- 🗣️ **Use Open Questions:** "What happens if...?" "How did you...?"
- 💚 **Validate Feelings:** "I see you're frustrated. Would you like help?"
- 🎉 **Celebrate Effort:** "You worked so hard on that drawing!"

### After the Activity

- 📝 Document observations (photos, notes)
- 🗂️ Update individual progress trackers
- 🧹 Involve children in clean-up (builds responsibility)
- 💬 Reflect with team: "What worked? What needs adjustment?"

1. **Design solutions**: Plan and sketch simple structures before building
2. **Build structures**: Use various materials to create towers, bridges, vehicles
3. **Test and improve**: Try out creations and make them better
4. **Understand simple machines**: Recognize wheels, ramps, levers in action
5. **Work collaboratively**: Share ideas, materials, and solve problems together
6. **Think like engineers**: Ask "How?" and "Why?" questions

### NCF Alignment

- **Thinking and Reasoning**: Design thinking, cause and effect, logical problem-solving

## 📝 Activity Steps (50 minutes)

### Part 1: Introduction to Engineering (10 minutes)

**Circle Time: What is an Engineer?**

1. **Introduce concept**:
   - "Engineers are people who **design and build** things to solve problems."
   - "Today, YOU are engineers! We'll build amazing creations."

2. **Show real-world examples**:
   - Pictures of bridges, buildings, robots, vehicles
   - "Engineers made all of these! What do you want to build?"

3. **Introduce design thinking**:
   - Show poster: Ask → Imagine → Plan → Create → Test → Improve
   - "Engineers don't give up! If something doesn't work, they try again."

4. **Present the challenge**:
   - **Challenge 1**: "Build the tallest tower that won't fall over!"
   - **Challenge 2**: "Create a ramp for a car to roll down"
   - **Challenge 3**: "Design a robot friend" (draw or build)

### Part 2: Design & Planning (10 minutes)

**Engineering Journals**

1. **Choose a challenge**: Each child/group picks one challenge
2. **Draw the design**: Sketch what they want to build
3. **List materials**: What will they need?
4. **Predict**: "How tall will it be? Will it work? Why?"

**Teacher Support**:

- Ask guiding questions: "What shape will be strongest?" "How will you make it stable?"
- Encourage labeling: Children dictate, teacher writes materials list
- No wrong answers: All designs are valid starting points

### Part 3: Building Time (20 minutes)

**Hands-On Engineering**

**Station 1: Tower Challenge** (tallest/strongest tower)

- Use blocks, cardboard, tape
- Test stability by placing stuffed animal on top
- Measure height with ruler or "hands tall"
- **Engineering concept**: Base width = stability

**Station 2: Ramp & Roll** (vehicle ramps)

- Build ramps with books, cardboard, blocks
- Test with toy cars, balls, or robots
- Experiment: Steep vs. gentle slopes
- **Engineering concept**: Gravity, incline, speed

**Station 3: Robot Workshop** (design robot friends)

- Build robots from cardboard boxes, tubes, foil
- Add features: Moving arms, LED eyes (optional)
- Simple circuits: Battery + LED (teacher-assisted)
- **Engineering concept**: Structure, movement, function

**Differentiation in Action**:

- **Beginners**: Simple stacking, teacher-guided steps
- **Advanced**: Complex structures, incorporate multiple simple machines
- **Mixed groups**: Peer mentoring, collaborative problem-solving

### Part 4: Testing & Iteration (5 minutes)

**Test Your Design!**

1. **Tower test**: How many books can it hold before falling?
2. **Ramp test**: Does the car roll? How far?
3. **Robot test**: Can it stand? Do parts move?

**What if it doesn't work?**

- Celebrate: "You found a problem! That's what engineers do!"
- Discuss: "What happened? Why do you think?"
- Improve: "What could we change? Let's try again!"

### Part 5: Showcase & Reflection (5 minutes)

**Engineer Presentations**

1. **Gallery walk**: Children visit each station
2. **Present designs**: Each child explains what they built
3. **Peer feedback**: "I like how you..." "I wonder if..."
4. **Take photos**: Document all creations

**Reflection Questions**:

- "What was hardest? How did you solve it?"
- "If you could build again, what would you change?"
- "Where do you see engineering in our classroom/home?"

## 🌈 Differentiation Strategies

### For Younger Children (3-4 years)

- **Simple stacking**: Focus on towers with large blocks
- **Open exploration**: Less structured, more free play
- **Teacher models first**: Show each step clearly
- **Shorter challenges**: 10-15 minutes building time
- **Celebrate effort**: Praise process, not just product

### For Older/Advanced Children (5-6 years)

- **Complex challenges**: "Build a bridge that holds 5 toy cars"
- **Multiple constraints**: "Use only 10 blocks and 3 pieces of tape"
- **Real engineering**: Introduce blueprints, scale drawings
- **Robot programming**: If using programmable robots, add simple coding
- **Journaling**: Write about the design process

### For Children with Additional Needs

- **Sensory-friendly**: Textured materials, quiet building space
- **Visual supports**: Step-by-step picture cards for each challenge
- **Adaptive tools**: Larger blocks, easier-grip connectors
- **Buddy system**: Pair with patient, encouraging peer
- **Break tasks down**: One step at a time with lots of praise

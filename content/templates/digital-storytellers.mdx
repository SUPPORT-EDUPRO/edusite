# Digital Storytellers: Literacy Meets Technology

## 🎯 Overview

Welcome to the **Digital Storytelling Revolution** for early learners! This activity bridges traditional storytelling with age-appropriate technology, helping children become **creators** rather than just consumers of digital media. Children will plan, create, and share their own digital stories using tablets, voice recording, simple apps, and multimedia tools—all while developing critical literacy and digital citizenship skills aligned with the NCF.

### Learning Objectives

1. **Plan a story**: Beginning, middle, end with characters and setting
2. **Use technology creatively**: Navigate apps, take photos, record voice
3. **Create digital content**: Combine images, voice, and text
4. **Present their work**: Share digital stories with peers
5. **Practice digital safety**: Understand screen time, appropriate content, privacy basics
6. **Integrate multimodal communication**: Use words, images, and voice together

### NCF Alignment

- **Communication**: Verbal, visual, and digital communication skills
- **Literacy**: Story structure, vocabulary, narrative skills
- **Creativity and Imagination**: Original story creation, problem-solving
- **Digital Literacy**: Technology use, digital citizenship, media creation

## 📝 Activity Steps (45 minutes)

### Part 1: Introduction to Digital Storytelling (10 minutes)

**Circle Time: Stories Can Be Digital!**

1. **Show examples**:
   - Display a simple digital storybook (pre-made or example)
   - "This story has pictures AND the author's voice reading it!"
   - Discuss: "How is this like/different from a regular book?"

2. **Introduce technology rules**:
   - **Two hands on tablet** (careful handling)
   - **Take turns** (everyone gets a chance)
   - **Kind pictures and words** (appropriate content)
   - **Screen time limits** (we'll do this for a short time, then do other activities)

3. **Digital citizenship basics**:
   - "When we take photos, we ask permission first"
   - "We don't share stories without teacher checking first"
   - "Technology is a tool to help us create!"

4. **Present today's mission**:
   - "You'll create your own digital story with pictures and your voice!"
   - Show simple story structure poster: Beginning → Middle → End

### Part 2: Story Planning (Unplugged - 10 minutes)

**Before we use technology, we plan!**

1. **Story brainstorming**:
   - "What will your story be about?"
   - Offer prompts: "A day at the park," "My family," "A friendly monster," "My pet"

2. **Complete story map** (worksheet or verbal):
   - **Characters**: Who is in your story?
   - **Setting**: Where does it happen?
   - **Beginning**: How does it start?
   - **Middle**: What happens?
   - **End**: How does it finish?

3. **Plan images**:
   - "What 3-5 pictures do we need?"
   - Will we draw them, take photos, or act them out?

4. **Partnership setup**:
   - Pair children (story partners)
   - One tells story, one helps with device (then switch)

### Part 3: Creating Digital Stories (20 minutes)

**Hands-On Technology Time!**

**Station 1: Story Creator App** (12 minutes)

1. **App orientation** (2 minutes):
   - Show how to open app, add page, insert image, record voice
   - Teacher demonstrates on projected screen first

2. **Content creation** (10 minutes):
   - Children add 3-5 pages to their story
   - Each page: Add image (photo/drawing) + record voice narrating that part
   - Teacher circulates, helping with technical issues
   - Encourage: "Tell your story in your own words!"

**Station 2: Photo Story** (alternative approach):

1. Take 3-5 photos with camera (acted out with props/toys)
2. Use voice recorder to narrate each photo
3. Teacher compiles later OR children sequence photos and play recordings

**Station 3: Video Story** (advanced option):

1. Use simple video app
2. Record child telling story with props/illustrations
3. Keep videos SHORT (30 seconds - 1 minute max)
4. Option to add stickers/text with teacher help

**Tips for Smooth Tech Time**:

- Keep groups small (2-3 per device)
- Have backup devices ready
- Designate "tech helpers" (responsible older children)
- Praise effort and creativity, not technical perfection

### Part 4: Sharing Circle (5 minutes)

**Story Celebration!**

1. **Author's chair**: Each child/pair presents their story
2. **Play digital story** on classroom screen
3. **Audience appreciation**: Clap, positive comments
4. **Quick reflection**: "What was your favorite part to make?"
